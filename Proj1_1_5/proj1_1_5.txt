The goal of these pieces of code was to get a better understanding of
the interface between sql and R. However, after learning how to connect
R to the database and the added difficulty sql made to the process
I decided to not follow expanding into adding sql queries into the 
main project. From proj1_1_5b I also had the experience again of not being
able to manipulate the RejectTestA.csv file to the extent I would like.
my goal with proj1_2 is to make my code more streamlined so I can easily
use this file without breaking it down into so many segments
