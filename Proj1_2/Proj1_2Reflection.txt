To cite my goals, I initially started with the objective of replacing a lot of
my commands in proj1_1 with sql functions to access data directly from the database.
While im still not opposed to this I believed that the sql package would
be an additional tool for R to clean data, and I found that the manipulation
it provided with sqlite was not up to the level I was looking for I sacked the
plan.

In lieu of updating my coding to include a nicer database manipulations I
proceeded instead to work on my coding efficeny which I believe was 
a huge success. In proj1_1 I had to take a random sample of 10k observations
since my computer physically couldnt process the data as I was hoping it would.
By doing research and getting access to the data.table, parallel, foreach,
doparallel, and learning how to use the apply family of functions to a 
much better degree. I managed to not only be able to process all my data
but I was able to do it faster than the 10k observation methods I used which
would require a seventy fold increase in speed. and additionally I was able to
begin testing new ggplot mapping, and managed to create my first heatmap.
Which allows me to conclude over all proj1_2 was a huge success.

To conclude this, I want to make a starting summary of my goals for project1_3.
My code is beginning to get a bit sloppy. not efficency wise but general
readablility. I am going to begin splititng the projects into subsegments
so one can be used strictly for cleaning while the other can reference that data.
